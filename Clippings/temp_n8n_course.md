# N8N FULL COURSE 5 HOURS (Build & Automate Anything)

n8n is a "source available" and "fair code" automation platform that enables you to build complex workflows and automate tasks without extensive coding knowledge. It's similar to Zapier or Make (formerly Integromat), but with a key difference: you can host it yourself.

## Key Features:

*   **Self-hosting:** You have full control over your data and can run n8n on your own servers. This is a major advantage for privacy-conscious users and businesses.
*   **Node-based interface:** You build workflows by connecting different "nodes." Each node represents an app or a service (like a database, an API, or a file system) and performs a specific action.
*   **Extensive integrations:** n8n supports hundreds of third-party applications and services.
*   **Customization:** You can write your own JavaScript code or create custom nodes to extend n8n's functionality.
*   **Community and paid versions:** There's a free community version and a paid version with additional features and support.

## Core Concepts:

*   **Workflow:** A series of connected nodes that automate a process.
*   **Node:** A building block of a workflow that performs a specific task.
*   **Trigger Node:** The starting point of a workflow, which initiates the automation when a specific event occurs (e.g., a new email arrives, a form is submitted, or on a schedule).
*   **Connection (or "Noodle"):** The line that connects two nodes, allowing data to flow between them.
*   **Credentials:** Securely stored authentication information (like API keys) that allows n8n to access your apps and services.
*   **Execution:** A single run of a workflow.

## Getting Started:

1.  **Installation:** You can run n8n using Docker, which is the recommended method.
2.  **Building your first workflow:**
    *   Start with a trigger node (e.g., a manual trigger or a webhook).
    *   Add regular nodes to perform actions.
    *   Connect the nodes and pass data between them.
    *   Test your workflow to make sure it works as expected.

## Example Use Cases:

*   **Automating social media posts:** Create a workflow that automatically posts your new blog articles to Twitter and LinkedIn.
*   **Syncing data between apps:** Keep your customer data consistent across your CRM and email marketing platform.
*   **Building custom internal tools:** Create a workflow that automatically generates reports, sends notifications, or manages user onboarding.
